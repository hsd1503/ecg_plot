# ECG Plot - Clinical ECG Visualization Library

A Python library for plotting clinical-grade ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals with medical standard compliance.

## 🏥 Clinical Applications

- **12-Lead ECG Analysis**: Standard clinical ECG interpretation
- **Rhythm Strip Monitoring**: Continuous cardiac rhythm analysis  
- **Research & Education**: ECG signal visualization for biomedical research
- **Telemedicine**: Remote ECG interpretation and reporting

## 📋 Features

### Current Features
- ✅ 12-lead ECG plotting with standard lead names
- ✅ Single-lead ECG visualization
- ✅ Clinical ECG grid (mimics standard ECG paper)
- ✅ Multiple export formats (PNG, SVG, JPG)
- ✅ Customizable styling and layout

### Planned Features (Contributing Welcome!)
- 🔄 Clinical standards compliance (25mm/s, 10mm/mV)
- 🔄 Heart rate calculation and R-peak detection
- 🔄 ECG measurements (PR, QRS, QT intervals)
- 🔄 Signal quality assessment
- 🔄 Standard ECG file format support (WFDB, EDF, DICOM)
